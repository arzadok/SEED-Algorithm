Brief description of project:

The goal of the project was to design and implement encryption block cipher algorithm on an FPGA device.

The project was carried out on the basys3 board, a complete, 
ready-to-use digital circuit development platform based on the latest Artix-7 Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) from Xilinx. 

Raspberry Pi 3 for the user interface software.

As in many cases, one of the designer’s main challenges is to carefully maintain balance between Timing considerations and Area considerations. 
Therefore, I used Iterative Implementation. 
I manage to implement two operation modes – encryption and decryption, with a very friendly user interface software.
This implementation demonstrates a fair combination of the two factors.

FPGA Implementation of the SEED Encryption Algorithm:

To run this project, follow the steps:

1. make sure you have:

    a. Basys 3

    b. Raspberry Pi

    c. 23 jumper wires

2. connect between Basys 3 and Raspberry Pi with jumper wires as shown in the table. (Project Report - page number 49)

3. Program FPGA with the bitstream

4. Run the Python code

That's it, Have fun! :)
